                    <h3>How We Met</h3>
                    <p>It all began on a crisp autumn day in October 2021. The leaves were changing, and as it turned out, so were our lives. Our first date quickly blossomed into something special. From our first conversation, we felt a connection that was hard to ignore, and before long, we found ourselves on a journey neither of us had anticipated but both of us embraced wholeheartedly.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h3>Our Journey Together</h3>
                    <p>Since that fateful day, we've built a life together in the vibrant city of Chicago, filling our days with the things we love most. We've explored new neighborhoods and hidden gems in our beloved city, turning our apartment into a home that reflects both of our personalities and backgrounds.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our shared passion for travel has taken us on adventures near and far, each trip adding another chapter to our story and strengthening our bond. From spontaneous weekend getaways to meticulously planned international explorations, we've collected memories that we'll cherish forever.</p>
                    
                    <p>When we're not plotting our next adventure, you might find us experimenting with art projects, trying our hand at new activities, or sampling our way through Chicago's diverse culinary scene. Our differences in background have only enriched our experiences together, as we constantly introduce each other to new traditions, flavors, and perspectives.</p>

                    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p>As we prepare to tie the knot in May 2026, we're filled with gratitude for the love and support of our families and friends who have been part of our journey. Our wedding celebration will be a reflection of who we are—a beautiful blend of cultures, traditions, and the new customs we've created together.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can't wait to share this special milestone with all of you, and to continue writing our story for many years to come.</p>

            <div class="traditions-content">
                <div class="tradition">
                    <h3>Baraat</h3>
                    <p>The Baraat is the groom's wedding procession. Mickey will arrive at the wedding venue on a decorated vehicle or horse, accompanied by his family and friends who dance joyfully to the rhythm of dhol drums. This lively procession symbolizes the happiness of the groom's family in welcoming a new member to their family.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tradition">
                    <h3>Mehndi</h3>
                    <p>The Mehndi ceremony involves the application of intricate henna designs on the bride's hands and feet, as well as for female guests who wish to participate. These beautiful designs symbolize joy, beauty, and spiritual awakening. The deeper the color of the mehndi, the stronger the bond between the bride and groom is said to be.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tradition">
                    <h3>Sangeet</h3>
                    <p>The Sangeet is a pre-wedding celebration filled with music, dance, and festivities. Both families come together to perform choreographed dances, sing traditional songs, and celebrate the union of the couple. It's a time for relaxation and enjoyment before the more formal wedding ceremony.</p>
                    <p class="special-note">We will have henna artists at the Sangeet who will be available to apply beautiful mehndi designs for <em>all guests</em> who are interested, regardless of gender or cultural background.
